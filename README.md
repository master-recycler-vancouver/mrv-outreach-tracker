### Starting Up the Project
1. Set up any environment variables in your `.env` (this is not committed to source control)
2. Set up a database.yml file (this is also not committed to source control).
3. Create, migrate, and seed the database:
    * `rails db:create rails db:migrate rails db:seed`
4. Start the server:
    * `rails s`
